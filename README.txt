mazeGen.cpp
  //definitions for the class implemented by mazeGen.h
  //builds the maze for the program to use
  //uses the node struct found in the static lib class
mazeGen.h
  //header file for mazeGen.cpp
  //defines class lib for miscelaneous liberal stuff such as Node
README.txt
  //defines all of the files
  //provides helpful meta information
  //also gives legal advice
  //Can share progress info at a quick glance. This is proof that programmers don't procrastinate.
leagal advice:
  //do not use this code without our permision
  //you have our unquestioned permision to use the code for any purpose, outside of other illegal activities; such as maze smuggling
lib.h
  //header file for the lib class basically where our graph class goes
  //contains the Node struct and its accompaniing functions
lib.cpp
  //defines the Node struct
mazeSolvent.cpp
  //utilizes and algorithm to solve a pre generated maze
mazeSolvent.h
  //header file for mazeSolvent.cpp
main.cpp
  //displays the generated and solved mazes
